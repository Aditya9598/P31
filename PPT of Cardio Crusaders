# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This Python script utilizes the `LogisticRegression` model from scikit-learn to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a given set of features. The dataset used is named "Heart Attack Data Set.csv."

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python heart_disease_prediction.py
   ```

   This will load the dataset, perform data analysis, split the data into training and testing sets, train a Logistic Regression model, and predict the likelihood of heart disease for a given input.

3. **Input New Data for Prediction:**

   Modify the `input_data` array with new values for features such as age, sex, blood pressure, etc., and rerun the script to see predictions.

## File Description

- **heart_disease_prediction.py:** Main script file containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **Heart Attack Data Set.csv:** Dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Additional Information

- The dataset should be in CSV format and have columns representing different features related to heart health.
- The model is a basic logistic regression model; you might consider exploring other models and hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
